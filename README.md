# Takoma

Takoma is a tool for managing switching AWS environments for several tools using
a unique credentials file.

To install takoma, read the code --do not trust this file-- and run:

   curl -fsSL https://github.com/pantulis/takoma/raw/master/install.sh | bash
   
## Migrating from tacoma

If you are using Tacoma, you should have a working ~/.tacoma.yml in your home directory.  Takoma
can migrate that for you with 'takoma upgrade_from_tacoma' --this needs the 'yq' utility installed.
